# Reports

This directory contains summaries, migration reports, and analysis documents that are **point-in-time** records rather than ongoing developer documentation.

## Contents

- Migration reports - Records of dependency upgrades and migrations
- Analysis documents - Code analysis and audit reports
- Performance reports - Performance benchmarks and optimization reports

## Purpose

Reports differ from documentation in `docs/`:

- **Documentation** (`docs/`) - How to use, configure, and develop with the plugin
- **Reports** (`reports/`) - What was done, when, and why (historical records)

## When to Add Reports

Add reports here when:

- Completing a major dependency migration (e.g., Stylelint 13 → 16)
- Documenting setup or configuration decisions
- Recording analysis or audit results
- Benchmarking performance changes

## Format

Reports should include:

- **Date**: When the report was created
- **Context**: What prompted the report
- **Findings**: Key information or results
- **Actions**: What was done or recommended
- **Outcome**: Results or current status
