# Dry Run Scripts

This folder contains all scripts and helpers related to dry-run validation and mustache placeholder replacement for the multi-block-plugin-scaffold.

- Place all dry-run logic here.
- Place dry-run related tests in `__tests__/`.
- TODO: Expand this README with CLI usage notes once the helper gains more commands.
