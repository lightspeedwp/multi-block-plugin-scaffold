# Changelog

All notable changes to the Multi-Block Plugin Scaffold will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `docs/FRONTMATTER_SCHEMA.md` now explains the agent frontmatter contract, points to `scripts/validation/audit-frontmatter.js`, and keeps schema updates in sync with `.github/schemas/frontmatter.schema.json`.
- Canonical schema assets live under `.github/schemas/` (block 6.9 reference, mustache registries, plugin config, plus example configs) and are verified by `scripts/validation/__tests__/validate-schemas.test.js`.
- Validation tools now centralise their naming conventions in `scripts/validation/README.md` and keep all `validate-*`, `audit-*`, `test-*`, and `define-*` scripts within `scripts/validation/`.
- `scripts/utils/dry-run-release.js` (and its test) produce sanitized copies of the release docs/agents so dry-runs can exercise templated `{{mustache}}` values without parser failures.

### Changed

- `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` now merges the previous release playbooks, documents reporting/planning folder rules, and highlights the `scripts/utils/dry-run-release.js` helper before `release.agent.js` runs against templated files.
- `package.json` validation scripts and `docs/GENERATE_PLUGIN.md` now call `scripts/validation/validate-plugin-config.js`, keeping CLI validation aligned with the action-first naming scheme.
- Instructions and prompts reference `.github/reports/`, `.github/projects/plans/`, and `tmp/` for reporting, planning, and temporary data, and the new frontmatter doc is linked from the docs index.

- Comprehensive schema validation for plugin configuration via JSON Schema
- Template variable validation system ensuring correct mustache usage throughout

#### Example Blocks

- **Card Block** - Display single items with featured image, title, excerpt, and custom fields
- **Collection Block** - Grid/list layouts with pagination, filtering, and query controls
