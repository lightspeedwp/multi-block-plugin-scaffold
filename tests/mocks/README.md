# Mocks Directory

This folder contains mock files and helpers for tests. Use this directory for:

- Mocking external dependencies
- Providing test doubles for integration/unit tests
- Storing reusable mock data

**Conventions:**

- Name files after the module or feature being mocked
- Add comments to explain usage
- Keep mocks up to date with code changes
